## Open source information of science and technology to defeat the Corona virus

Our globalised world has optimised for two things: speed and low prices.  It is not optimised for resilience.  We might like to think of ourselves as islands but generic drugs and PPE that keep us safe are manufactured in Indian and China.  Likewise test kits and ventilator designs are produced here and elsewhere.  There are a myriad of connections.  We depend on each other.

We have some of the technologies needed to defeat corona virus right now.  Over the next few months, we'll get more.  But we need to do two things:

1. buy ourselves time to scale up those technologies
1. share our knowledge to scale up those technologies faster, globally

This is an open call to all IP (intellectual property) owners to release your IP.  Show us and help us build your technology to defeat this challenge.

## These businesses need to realise two things

1.  They can make a lot of money out of licensing these technologies.  We will need billions of tests per day.  Not millions per month (see Qiagen's "dramatically ramping up" to [10 million tests per month by June](https://corporate.qiagen.com/newsroom/press-releases/2020/20200317_capacity_increase)  This level of testing is woefully inadequate)
2.  The slower they are to act then the very fabric that their business value is built on; skilled people, research budgets, consumption, capitalism, will be eaten away over the next weeks and months.  And the exponentially greater risk people will just go around them.  There's already multiple international efforts underway to develop and scale up open tests in spite of these companies rather than enabled by them.
