<blockquote>
  <p>Bear in mind the lessons learned and debated by the #wearenotwaiting movement, who are type 1 diabetics developing open source continuous loop tech for other type 1 diabetics.
   Variants on Van Halen’s ‘no brown M&amp;Ms’ rider; bury instructions critical to get the thing to turn on at all together with the tricky settings that users need to understand to make it work safely
  Using technical language to explain and github to host, again, to create barriers that require focus
  Provide ongoing technical support through multiple channels. Once someone has   built it successfully, they are a resource for others; make sharing support easy.</p>
