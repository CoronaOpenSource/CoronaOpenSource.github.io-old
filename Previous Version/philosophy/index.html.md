# Ethics & practicalities of delivering life-saving hardware onto a desperate and non-technical public

> Bear in mind the lessons learned and debated by the #wearenotwaiting movement, who are type 1 diabetics developing open source continuous loop tech for other type 1 diabetics.
>  Variants on Van Halen’s ‘no brown M&Ms’ rider; bury instructions critical to get the thing to turn on at all together with the tricky settings that users need to understand to make it work safely
> Using technical language to explain and github to host, again, to create barriers that require focus
> Provide ongoing technical support through multiple channels. Once someone has   built it successfully, they are a resource for others; make sharing support easy.
